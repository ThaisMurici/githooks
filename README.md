<p align="center">Simple project used to learn React Hooks. Based on the video <a href="https://youtu.be/6WB16wZS61c">React Hooks na prática</a>, by Rocketseat.</p>

## Features

[//]: # "Add the features of your project here:"

This app is built using:

- ⚛️ **React Js** — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## Key observations

- **Functions inside components:** since components are now written as functions instead of classes, there's no need to use **this** anymore. To use functions, simply declare them inside your component (yes! functions inside functions). In JavaScript, when a function is declared inside another function, it gets scoped inside its parent. That way, it is not possible to access it externally.

## Getting started

To run this project, just clone it and execute the following:

```js
yarn install            // install dependencies
yarn start              // run project
```
